Hi, 

My name is Tony, I'm a software engineer and the creator of freedomsponsors.
I made this screencast to explain to you what this website is about.

Well, here goes.

As developers, we all love open source stuff.
But sometimes, development goes slower than we would like it to. 
FreedomSponsors want to help improve that - And I'll tell you how.

You know how open source projects have their issue trackers, right?
People go there and ask for bugfixes and new features.

Some even have a voting system
And developers use the results to prioritize their work.

But what if you need a feature or a bugfix, and you need it so bad that 
you would be willing to even PAY a few bucks for it

Here's what you can do:

First, after you create your account here at FreedomSponsors, you can register an offer for that issue.
The new offer points to the original issue in the project's issue tracker

Other people might also need the same thing, so when they see your offer, they step up and throw in a few bucks too. 
You guys just became sponsors for that specific issue. But relax, nobody's paying anything yet!

Then, you go back to the issue on its original issue tracker page, and drop a comment telling the developers about your offer.

Over time, that issue acumulates "potential money", which is way more interesting than just votes, right?

The issue eventually gets resolved. The developer then can come here at FreedomSponsors and say "hey, I solved it. Pay up"

As a sponsor, you go and and see if it really solves your problem.
If it does, you pay the guy. If it doesn't, you don't.
At that point, everyone is gonna need Paypal accounts! And that's it.
We do get a tiny cut out of the developer's pay - 3% (not 20, not 10, not 5. Just 3. We're not greedy, nor evil - but we do gotta keep business running :-))

We know that idea sounds a little crazy...

You're probably thinking "what if this" and "what if that"... 
Maybe the FAQ has some answers for the questions you might be asking yourself. Care to check it out?

We believe that the guys working on those projects deserve to make some money out of it.
We believe that people should be able to influence the direction of those projects according to their needs.
We believe that things could move faster in the open source world.

And yeah, we believe we can make that happen.

So, if you love open source too, and you believe in that vision

1) Sign up (it's really easy, all you need is a GMail account)
2) Spread the word - everyone needs to know about us for that to happen.

Oh, and last but not least

Our system is still at beta stage. Find any bugs, got any suggestions or comments?
Don't hesitate to send us your feedback (really, we love feedback).

I did mention spreading the word, right?

Yeah, yeah! I mean Twitter, Facebook, Google+... C'mon man you gotta tell everyone, go go go! :-)
Well, that's about it. Thanks for your time, and happy sponsoring!
Oh, don't for get to like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter!
