    Hello {{ you.getUserInfo.screenName }}, welcome to <a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/">FreedomSponsors</a><br>
<br>
    Thank you for believing in the FreedomSponsors idea. Let's make Free Software even better together! :-) <br>
 <br>
    Please take a few minutes to take a look at the <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/about/">about page</a>, and also <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/faq/">the FAQ</a>. <br>
 <br>
    If you own any Github repositories, you might find the <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/freedomsponsors-github-integration/">Github integration</a> feature interesting. <br>
    Similiar functionality is also available for the JIRA issue tracker as a <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/freedomsponsors-jira-plugin">JIRA plugin</a>. <br>
 <br>
    <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/">The blog</a> has constant updates about the platform.  <br>

    And if you'd like to help, you're very welcome! <br>
 <br>
    Right now we're trying to make FreedomSponsors known by as many developers as possible, so please help spread the word. Crowdfunding will only work when there's an actual crowd. Even a single tweet is fine :-) <br>
