      <p>You are proposing this issue on FreedomSponsors, but the stakeholders of the <a href="{{issue.trackerURL}}" target="_issue">original issue</a> 
        probably don't know about it. To get people to place bounties here, they must know that they can!</p>
      <p>A good way to make that happen is to drop a comment there telling about FreedomSponsors.<br>
        Of course, you can talk about in other forums too.<br/>
