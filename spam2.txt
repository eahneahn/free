Hi Nixie,

My name is Tony, I'm a software engineer in Brazil. 
Can I have a minute?

I want to show you something - a website I made called FreedomSponsors.

FS is a crowdfunding platform where people can place small money bounties for
open issues of open source projects.
 
So far it's only got a few offers - but it's slowly growing and people seem to get pretty interested when they look into it.
I really think that as it gets more popular, this tool can have a big positive impact on a lot of open source projects, especially popular ones like Linux and related projects.

Can you please take a look?

What do you think? :-)
 
The FS website is still in beta stage, but functionality is pretty stable, and I will implement a few improvements and new functionality soon.
FS is open source on Github (it's a Python+Django app), and feedback and help is welcome! :-)

Now I think it's time to "viralize" it, so I'm trying to make FS known by developers and all sorts of open-source infected Geeks around the world, as much as I can.
You think you could give me a hand with that? 
Since you're so popular in the geek community, I believe a tweet or a facebook share would have a decent impact of visibility for FS.

Thanks!
Tony LÃ¢mpada - the FreedomSponsors guy
